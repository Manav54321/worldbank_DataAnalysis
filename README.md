# worldbank_populations data analysis:

### Introduction
The notebook analyzes world population data using various Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

### Steps Taken

1. **Imported Libraries**: Necessary tools for data handling, statistical analysis, and creating visualizations were loaded.

2. **Loaded Data**: The primary dataset containing population data was read from a CSV file.

3. **Initial Data Inspection**:
   - **First 10 Rows**: The first 10 rows were displayed to get a quick look at the data.
   - **Dataset Shape**: The size of the dataset was checked to understand its dimensions.
   - **Unique Indicator Names**: The different indicators in the data were listed.
   - **Dataset Information**: A summary of the dataset's structure was provided.
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Basic statistical insights were offered.

4. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Unwanted columns were removed.
   - Random samples were displayed to verify the cleaning process.
   - The last rows of the dataset were checked.

5. **Country Analysis**:
   - The different countries in the dataset were identified.

   - **Top 10 Countries by Population**:
     - The total population for each country across all years was calculated.
     - The top 10 most populous countries were listed.
     - A bar chart was created to visualize the top 10 countries by population.

   - **Bottom 10 Countries by Population**:
     - The 10 least populous countries were listed.
     - A bar chart was created to visualize the bottom 10 countries by population.

6. **Additional Data Loading**:
   - Another CSV file with metadata about countries was read.

7. **Merging Data**:
   - The population data was combined with the metadata.

8. **Income Group Analysis**:

   - **Population by Income Group**:
     - The population data was aggregated by income group for 1960 and 2022.
     - A bar chart was created to compare the population by income group for 1960 and 2022.

   - **Distribution of Income Groups**:
     - The number of countries in each income group was counted.
     - A bar chart showing the distribution of income groups was created.

9. **Population Growth Visualization**:

   - **World Population Growth**:
     - The data was transposed to get years as rows.
     - A line chart showing world population growth from 1960 to 2022 was created.

   - **Population Growth of Selected Countries**:
     - Population growth of India, China, the USA, and Germany from 1960 to 2022 was compared.
     - A line chart for these selected countries was created.

### Conclusion
The notebook provided a comprehensive analysis of world population trends, highlighting differences among countries and income groups, and visualizing historical population growth. This analysis included identifying the most and least populous countries, comparing population data by income groups, and examining population growth trends from 1960 to 2022.
